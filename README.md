# adamantite

a tiny, lightweight markdown parser for static site generators.

as this crate is in a very, very early stage and nowhere near ready for use i
recommend you choose another markdown parsing solution from <https://crates.io>.

## building

`nix build`, `nix run`, `nix flake check`, `nix develop` are all fully
integrated with the Rust toolchain and build / run tests.

`nix build .#book` builds the design book.
